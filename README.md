# Modbus <-> MQTT Gateway

![code-analysis](https://github.com/mazocode/modbus2mqtt/actions/workflows/run-code-analysis.yaml/badge.svg)

This is a gateway between Modbus and MQTT. It was originally developed to read registers from PV inverters via Modbus and publish them as MQTT message. The gateway 
can read from one or more Modbus TCP gateways (e.g. the Waveshare RS485 to Ethernet) simultaneously. The state of the coils can be published as a json message and their 
state can also be changed with a json message sent to the rpc topic.


## Configuration

Create a configuration file (see examples/). Here is the basic syntax:

```yaml
mqtt:

  # Broker connection parameters

  host: "<mqtt-host>"    # <--- (optional) MQTT broker host (default is localhost)
  port: 1883             # <--- (optional) MQTT broker port (default is 1883)
  tls: false             # <--- (optional) Use TLS for broker connection (default is False)
  username: "<username>" # <--- (required) Client username
  password: "<password>" # <--- (required) Client password
  clientid: "myclient"   # <--- (optional) The client id (default is modbus2mqtt)
  topic_prefix: "deye"   # <--- (optional) Path that will prepend all topics before publication, if set


schema:

  # You can publish data from different devices in parallel. Create
  # a schema for each device type with the registers to publish:

      typereg: holding      # <--- (optional) Read holding or input register (default is holding)
      format: integer       # <--- (optional) Read integer or float value (default is integer)

      wordorder: big        # <--- (optional) Wordorder (if length > 2) as little or big (default is big)
      littleendian: 0       # <--- (optional) Shortcut for byteorder and wordorder as little if true

   # Coils
 
   - name: "Digital Outputs 1"
     topic: "outputs"
     unitid: 2
     register: 0
     coils:
     - name: "switch1"       # <--- (required) Property to use in the json message sent to the topic
       bit: 1                # <--- (optional) bit (coil) to read from (default is 1)
       on_value: 1           # <--- (optional) Json value if bit is set (default is "ON")
       off_value: 0          # <--- (optional) Json value is bit is unset (default is "OFF")
       mode: r               # <--- (optional) Coil is read-only if set to r. (default: rw)
     - name: "switch3"
       bit: 3
       on_value: True
       off_value: False

    # ...

sources:

  # Your modbus sources to retrieve data from

  - name: "deye-inverter"  # <--- (required) Name of your soruce
    schema: deye-inverter  # <--- (required) Name of the schema to read from this device
    host: "192.168.0.30"   # <--- (optional) Replace with the modbus gateway IP (default is loclahost)
    port: 502              # <--- (optional) Port your gateway is listening on (default is 502)
    unitid: 1              # <--- (optional) Modbus device id to read from (default is 1)
    topic_prefix: "abc"    # <--- (optional) Appened after <mqtt.topic_prefix>/
    control_topic: "abc"   # <--- (optional) Topic to publish online state and listen to rpc messages on
                                   Appened after <mqtt.topic_prefix>/. Dfault is name
    pollms: 1000           # <--- (optional) Modbus polling interval in ms (default is 1000)
```


## Running

### Docker

Mount the configuration file to /config.yaml:

```bash
docker run --rm \
	--net host \
	--volume ./config.yaml:/config.yaml:ro \
	ghcr.io/mazocode/modbus2mqtt
```

### Systemd

Adjust the service definition from systemd/ with the path you have clone the repository into and the path to your configuration file.

### Manual 

```bash
modbus2mqtt.py -c /path/to/config.yaml
```

## RPC Topic

The gateway will listen to commands on the /rpc topic prefix of each modbus source. Example:
```yaml
mqtt:
  topic_prefix: "root"

schema:
- name: neuron
  readings:
  - name: "Digital Outputs 1"
    topic: "outputs"
    unitid: 1
    register: 0
    coils:
    - name: "switch1"
      bit: 1
      on_value: "Yes"
      off_value: "No"

sources:
  - name: "mydevice"
    schema: neuron
    topic_prefix: "b"
  - name: "mydevice"
    schema: neuron
    topic_prefix: "c"
```

This configuration will listen to topic /root/b/rpc and topic /root/c/rpc for commands to the second modbus device. For now there is only a single command
implemented for setting the stat eof a single coil. The general syntax of the json message you can send to the rpc topic is:

```json
{ 
  "method": "set", 
  "target": "outputs", 
  "params": { 
    "value": false, 
    "coil": "switch1" 
  } 
}
```

The value can be any boolean representation understood by python or a value specified with on_value or off_value within the schema definition.


## Examples

### Home Assistant with Deye SUN-xK-SG04LP3-EU inverters

See examples/Deye-SG04LP3-EU/

You can use home-assistant.yaml as a template for the MQTT integration. This example assumes messages are published to the following topic syntax: pv/plant-id/inverter-id:

```yaml
mqtt:
  topic_prefix: "pv"

schema:
  - name: "deye-sg04lp3-eu"
    readings:
    - name: "System State"
      topic: "system/state" # <--- becomes pv/i<1,2,3>/system/state
      # ...

sources:
  - name: "inverter1"
    schema: deye-sg04lp3-eu
    topic_prefix: "1/i1"    # <--- becomes pv/1/i1
  - name: "inverter2"
    schema: deye-sg04lp3-eu
    topic_prefix: "1/i2"    # <--- becomes pv/1/i2
    # ...
```
